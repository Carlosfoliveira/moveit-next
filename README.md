##🎯 Objective

Track your time, be more productive and take care of your health. <a href="https://moveit-five-lemon.vercel.app/">Move.it</a> was developed for time management, as in the pomodoro technique, dividing the work into 25 minute periods. After that time it releases a challenge, which is some stretching for the body or exercise for the eyes. Each challenge has its xp points and, accumulating the points you level up.
